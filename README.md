## Marius Lumbroso
**Backend Architect | AI Developer | MIR Researcher**

I am a software architect and developer with over eight years of experience engineering resilient, cloud-native systems and data-processing pipelines. My core expertise lies in C#/.NET, Python, and JavaScript, with a specialized focus on machine learning and digital signal processing.

Currently, I am the founder and lead architect behind [Ivory](https://ivory-app.com), an advanced piano transcription tool. My primary work involves researching and developing proprietary Artificial Intelligence models dedicated to Music Information Retrieval (MIR). These neural networks—engineered and trained entirely from scratch—are designed to solve complex polyphonic transcription challenges, converting raw piano audio into highly accurate, editable music notation. 

Ivory serves thousand of pianists monthly, powered by a robust backend and a Vue-driven web interface that instantly processes direct audio uploads and YouTube streams. Beyond Ivory, I continue to architect libraries, developer tools, and scalable infrastructures for enterprise clients across Europe.
